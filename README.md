# Purpose

Mobile applications play a relevant role in users' daily lives by improving and easing daily processes such as commuting or making financial transactions. The aforementioned interactions enhance the usability of commonly used services. Nevertheless, the improvements should also consider special execution environments such as weak network connections or special requirements inherited from the user's condition. Due to this, the design of mobile applications should be driven by improving the user experience. This tutorial targets the usage of inclusive and accessibility design in the development process of mobile apps. Making sure that applications are accessible to all users, regardless of disabilities, is not just about following the law or fulfilling ethical obligations; it is crucial in creating inclusive and fair digital environments. This tutorial will educate participants on accessibility principles and the available tools. They will gain practical experience with specific Android and iOS platform features, as well as become acquainted with state-of-the-art automated and manual testing tools.
